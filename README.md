# Project1
Here in this project we are using EHR-pancreatic data. In this dataset The column1 - "Sensitization type" is the dependent variable (Widespread and Segmental). 
The dataset is imbalanced.
We are developing a simple classification algorithms using a simple 3-layer Neural network, two-layer CNN, and a two-layer LSTM respectively.
Also applied techniques to get better output, like (a) k-fold cross-validation, (b) leave one subject out cross-validation and (c) k-stratified cross-validation.
Also computed Compute Performance metrics namely F-measure, precision, recall and ROC curve with a confusion matrix.
